<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

This Lab of Data Mining/Data Science and Analytics/ Machine Learning aims to make the students Understand the concept of classification, Clustering, Big Data Analysis .It explains the Importance of Data Analytics in gaining certain Business Intelligence or see some Patten or do some Predictions & Forecasting with the help of the huge data that we get from various sources. It helps the students in understanding various concepts in Machine Learning/ Data Science / Data Mining and train them with relevant tool such as WEKA which is heavily used in the rapidly growing field of Data Science, Machine Learning/ Data Science / Data Mining for Analytics purpose.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

 The experiment tends to explain the concept of Classification in Data Mining and Machine Learning that uses Naïve Bayes Classifier Algorithm in WEKA. We assume that appropriate data preprocessing has been performed on the available Data set

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

    • Senior undergraduate students 
    • Postgraduate students 
    • Research scholars 

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

This experiment is aligned with course like  Data Mining, Machine Learning and Data Analytics.

<h5> Universities Mapped : </h5>

APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University
